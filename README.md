# 🎬 PLM-FLIX – University Web Streaming Project

This is a web application built as part of a **university course project**. It simulates a movie and TV show streaming platform, inspired by popular services like Netflix.

Instead of using actual copyrighted content, this application allows administrators to add YouTube video URLs, which are then displayed as if they were part of the platform's media catalog.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This is a student project developed purely for academic and educational purposes. It is not intended for commercial use or public distribution.
